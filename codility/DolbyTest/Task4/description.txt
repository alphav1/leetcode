FUNCTION SIGNATURE:
int solution(vector<string> &visits);

PARAMETERS:
- visits: A list of length N representing the days Ellis visits the gym, in chronological order
- Days of the week are represented as three-letter strings: "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"

RETURN VALUE:
The minimum number of gym membership cards that Ellis must purchase based on the order of visits specified.

EXAMPLES:

1. visits = ["Tue", "Sat", "Mon", "Fri"]
   Expected return: 2
   Explanation: In the first week, Ellis visits the gym on Tuesday and Saturday. 
                In the second week, Ellis visits the gym on Monday and Friday.

2. visits = ["Mon", "Mon", "Mon"]
   Expected return: 3
   Explanation: Ellis visits the gym only on Monday each week.

3. visits = ["Sun", "Sat", "Fri", "Thu", "Wed", "Tue", "Mon"]
   Expected return: 7
   Explanation: Each visit requires a new membership card as they span multiple weeks.

CONSTRAINTS:
- N is an integer within the range [1..100]
- The only strings in visits are: "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"
- Focus on correctness. Performance is not the focus of the assessment.

KEY INSIGHTS:
